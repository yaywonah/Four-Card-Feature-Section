## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I finally learned how to use CSS grid! I also learned more about box shadow and how to make only one side of the border visible. I also learned how to usee Flexbox and grid in order to create the cross layout. I also made this without relying on the Figma design files.

### Useful resources

- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxwsEZxa1AI&t=498s&pp=ygUqZnJvbnQgZW5kIG1lbnRvciBmb3VyIGNhcmQgZmVhdHVyZSBzZWN0aW9u) - I got stuck trying to figure out how to arrange the cards because I was only focusing one or the other for CSS grid and flexbox. This video taught me that I can use both.
